# Personal Website (Vanilla JS)

This is a simple, modern single-page personal website to showcase my resume built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

I generated the template using GitHub Copilot and filled in the personal information myself. I plan on updating it over time to give it more of a "me" feel and stay up to date with my life achievements.

Files
- index.html — main page
- css/styles.css — styling and print rules
- js/app.js — loads `data/resume.json` and adds interactivity
- data/resume.json — structured resume data to edit
